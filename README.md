2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won.
4. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Election Audit Summary
This script could be modified to show, if the information is available, how many people voted using the various methods of voting such as mail-in ballot, in-person, or early voting. This can help election officials and election analysts to determine how people are voting and if there is a need for additional infrastructure, such as more in-person voting sites. This can be accomplished by following the same pattern established in the script to find the counties and candidates as well as count each instance of the counties and candidates.

And additional way the code could be modified to show if a run off election is needed if no candidate wins the majority of votes. This could be added to the `if` statement that determines the winning candidate, pictured below.
